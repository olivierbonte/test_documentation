# test_documentation
Repo to test MkDocs for internal documentation 

To create this site, following guides were used:

- https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/
- https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/
- https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/ 

## For developpers

With conda, install the computational environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate test_documentation
```

You can now test if mkdocs is installed by e.g. running:
```
mkdocs --version
```
